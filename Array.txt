Here are 10 questions based on the two-pointer algorithm that can help you practice and understand the concept better:

Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

Problem: Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an array of length 2.
Example: Input: numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9, Output: [1, 2]
3Sum

Problem: Given an array nums of n integers, find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
Example: Input: nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4], Output: [[-1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 2]]
Container With Most Water

Problem: Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i are at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis, forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Example: Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7], Output: 49
Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Problem: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and returns the new length.
Example: Input: nums = [1, 1, 2], Output: 2
Move Zeroes

Problem: Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
Example: Input: nums = [0, 1, 0, 3, 12], Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
Backspace String Compare

Problem: Given two strings s and t, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.
Example: Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c", Output: true
Valid Palindrome II

Problem: Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.
Example: Input: s = "abca", Output: true
Squares of a Sorted Array

Problem: Given an array of integers A sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number, also in sorted non-decreasing order.
Example: Input: A = [-4,-1,0,3,10], Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Problem: Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.
Example: Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3], Output: 2
Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters

Problem: Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring t that contains at most 2 distinct characters.
Example: Input: s = "eceba", Output: 3
